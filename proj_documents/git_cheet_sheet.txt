##  ATTENTION: Always make a back of your source folder before messing with git.  You can loose things mistakenly in this process!

#Step one download and install "Git"  (not github) These are super detailed.  It's not really that complex.
#https://git-scm.com/download/win 
#choose the defaults and notepad as the default editor if you don't have another preference

#Open Command Line and run the following commands to setup username and email
win + r

#type
cmd

#press enter and a comand prompt should open
#you can type  git --help to see if git is installed and see a list of program commands
git --help


#enter the following commands to configure git with your personal information.  
#This will show up on your git hub submissions.  Your future employers may see this so keep that in mind.

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youraddr@emailaddress.com"

#Open github and make sure your logged in.
#Go to https://github.com/sentient-russ/ADAD
#while logged in select the fork button in the top right corner while inside the ADAD repository
#This creates a new forked branch (copy of the repository) under your account
#Click your username breadcrum in the top left to return to your account profile
#At the top left you should have a link for repositories.
#Select the link.  You should see your forked copy of ADAD. Clicking the link will take you to your master branch.

#now that you have a copy you need to cone it to your system so that you can work on it.
#If you do not have visual studio 2022 or later you will need to download and install the community version (free) from #https://visualstudio.microsoft.com 
#By default the repos folder contains the viual studio project files.  Return to the cmd prompt and change to the repos directory.  
cd c:/Users/<your_usr_name>/source/repos/

#In my case its "cd c:/Users/russe/source/repos/
#Once your in the correct folder you can clone you forked copy of the repository
#The url comes from your github account.  go there and click the green code button.  
#select the copy button for Clone->Https "Clone using the web URL" option
#back in the cmd window that is currently in your repos folder type the following command
git clone "your url"

#for me it looks like "git clone https://github.com/sentient-russ/gcai.git"
#This will make a local copy that you can work off of on your computer.

#You can now open visual studio and edit the project.

#Instructions for submiting your changes for inclussion in the groups main branch

#Open the cmd prompt.
#go to your repos/ADAD folder
cd c:/Users/<your_usr_name>/source/repos/ADAD 

#While inside the folder type the following command with a . to bundle all of your changes togeter
git add .

#Then add a commit message to the bundle
#This is an important point. Only make a set of related changes per commit.  
#Do not change unrelated stuff all over the project.  
#Your pull request will get rejected and this will result in more work for you."
git commit -m "Enter a short description of your changes here."

#Once this is done you may upload your changes to your branch master by typing 
git push origin master

#You can now go to the repository in your account and make sure that the changes have been uploaded by browsing the contents of a file online to see that a recent change is present.
#The last step is submitting a pull request. A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another.
#From your github accounts copy (branch) you may click on the "Pull Requests" option.
#Select the green "New pull request" button.
#Reveiw your changes and select "Create pull request"

#Thats it.  From there I will review and hopefully just merge the changes into the group branch.  If things don't go as planned let me know.  I am happy to help.
